### Lecture-1 
Test_data Sets 
Linear Regeresoin; least squre problem. 
finally we have a linear system of equation dreived from an optimization problem. 
SVM : support Vector  Machine 
Minimizing Function + some extera properties
NN : try to mimic brain
See an animation of how Neuron works.
The stuvture of network is fixes 
What are the difference between a gpu work on ML and HPC.

* Def1: given a finite or sometimes sets of data pairs (x_i,y_i) x_i \in R^m we look for a function: 
    f: R^m --> R^n
can be subject to noise y_i=f(x_i) + \psi with expectation that E(\psi)=0 
the goal find 
    f_thta : R^m --> R^n s.t data is explained best.

ask for the for defenition of ML
