## Question ?
1. How to automate the process?
	It seems that there are platform which give you acssess to phone online and you can test them tthere obviously this is not what we want or have? but we can somehow use it for ios testing maybe?
[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)
[Sauce Labs](Sauce Labs) or AWS Device Farm
so automating the process is not reasonable now, maybe there are some external platform required like above.

2. What are the test that we are going to write ?
	we should categorize it? Start with functional test, then move along.
3. How are we going to collaborate and place the test ?
	I should create Tests and folders. 
4. I should figure out how to handle things correctly with bash the oh-my-Zsh is problem sometime I should stick to bash for my working laptop 

Ask for gitlab poroject,

test runner in python : pytest or nose

Obtain the APK file of your Android app this i did it it uses android sdk can be useul 




So Here is a conceptual view:
	- Appium Server: Acts as a bridge between your test scripts and the mobile device.
	- Desired Capabilities: Define the test environment (device, OS, app details).
	- Element Locators: Methods to identify and interact with app elements (e.g., id, xpath).
