Now I got to do something with appliation testing,

What is the difference between 
sudo su- and sudo -i ?

here is an alternative to Docker called Podman. The primary differ-
ence between the two tools is that Docker requires a server to be running
when using containers, while Podman does not.

Fortunately for the kernel, there is help. Modern CPUs include a memory
management unit (MMU) that enables a memory access scheme called virtual
memory. When using virtual memory, a process does not directly access the
memory by its physical location in the hardware. Instead, the kernel sets up
each process to act as if it had an entire machine to itself. When the pro-
cess accesses some of its memory, the MMU intercepts the access and uses
a memory address map to translate the memory location from the process
point of view into an actual physical memory location in the machine. The
kernel must still initialize and continuously maintain and alter this mem-
ory address map. For example, during a context switch, the kernel has to
change the map from the outgoing process to the incoming process.
 	The implementation of a memory address map is called a page table.

The cd command is a shell built-in. It wouldn’t work as a separate program because
if it were to run as a subprocess, it could not (normally) change its parent’s current
working directory. This may not seem a particularly important distinction at the
moment, but there are times when knowing this fact can clear up confusion.

If you like math and are interested in where regular expressions come
from, look up Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation,
3rd edition, by Jeffrey Ullman and John Hopcroft (Prentice Hall, 2006).
