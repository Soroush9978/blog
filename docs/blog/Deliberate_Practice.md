# Some notes from the book: Talent is overrated !
The key point of mastery is deliberate practice:
    - It can not be done more than 5-6 hours per day, 
    - It is very very hard =)) 
    - It should be done in learning zone, not be so hard and not be very easy
    - outsider eye is always good. 
    - It should be practice continuously.
    - experience does not grantee the success
    - deliberate practice should be focused on the subject
