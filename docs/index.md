## About
Hi! I'm a math student who’s always been curious about how things work—both in theory and in practice. I love the beauty of abstract math, but I’m just as excited about the world of computer science, especially when it comes to Linux and open-source tools. There’s something really satisfying about tinkering with systems, writing code, and learning through trial and error. I enjoy finding that sweet spot where logical thinking meets creative problem-solving—and I’m always up for exploring new ideas, whether it’s through a math proof or a terminal window.
